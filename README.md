# For developing the site locally
This site is developed using pipenv as it's virtual environment so best to use these commands when using these commands after installing python:

1. Create virtual environment: % pip3 install pipenv
2. Activate the virtual environment: % pipenv shell
3. Using pipenv to install the packages locally: % pipenv install
4. When you want to test the site locally run: % python3 main.py
5. When you are done using with the updates of the program deactivate your pipenv session by doing: % exit
